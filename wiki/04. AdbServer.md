## Description
**AdbServer** is simple comfortable wrapper over [AdbServer repository](https://github.com/matzuk/AdbServer). Please check [AdbServer repository README](https://github.com/matzuk/AdbServer/blob/github/README.md) for more information about principles of how it works.<br>
As it was mentioned at [Device wiki](https://github.com/matzuk/Kaspresso/wiki/Device), ```device``` uses **AdbServer** under the hood in most cases. <br>

## Usage
**AdbServer** instance is available in ```BaseTestContext``` scope via ```adbServer``` property. So, you can use it in test cases or in methods that extend ```BaseTestContext``` class. <br>
Before using of **AdbServer** you have to execute *artifacts/desktop.jar* on your local machine or a server where you run tests. <br>
The command to execute is
```
java -jar desktop.jar
```
