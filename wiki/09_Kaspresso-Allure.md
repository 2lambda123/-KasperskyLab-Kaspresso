# Kaspresso-allure support

## _What's new_
In new **1.3.0** Kaspresso release the [**allure-framework**](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-kotlin) support was added. Now it is very easy to generate pretty test reports using both Kaspresso and Allure frameworks.

In this release the file-managing classes family responsible for providing files for screenshots and logs was refactored for better usage and extensibilty and the old classes were deprecated (see package [**com.kaspersky.kaspresso.files**](../kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/files)). Usage example: [**CustomizedSimpleTest**](../samples/kaspresso-sample/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspressample/simple_tests/CustomizedSimpleTest.kt).

Also the interceptors for tests video recording and for dumping xml-representation of view hierarchy on test failures were added (see [**VideoRecordingInterceptor**](../kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/interceptors/watcher/testcase/impl/video/VideoRecordingInterceptor), [**DumpViewsInterceptor**](../kaspresso/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/interceptors/watcher/testcase/impl/views/DumpViewsInterceptor)).

And special implementations of Kaspresso interceptors linking and processing theese files for including to Allure-report also added in this release (see package [**com.kaspersky.components.alluresupport.interceptors**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/interceptors)).

## _How to use_
To add the dependency to **allure-support** Kaspresso module to your project just add the following line to the **build.gradle** file where you add the main Kaspresso module dependency:
```
androidTestImplementation "com.kaspersky.android-components:allure-support:1.3.0"
```
After the gadle sync the list of special interceptors linking and processing the files to add them to allure-report becomes available to use. You can add them to your Kaspresso build using [**withAllureSupport**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/AllureSupportKaspressoBuilder.kt) function:
```
class AllureSupportTest : TestCase(
    kaspressoBuilder = Kaspresso.Builder.withAllureSupport()
) {
```
If you want to specify the parameters or add more interceptors you can use [**addAllureSupport**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/AllureSupportKaspressoBuilder.kt) function:
```
class AllureSupportCustomizeTest : TestCase(
    kaspressoBuilder = Kaspresso.Builder.simple(
        customize = {
            videoParams = VideoParams(bitRate = 10_000_000)
            screenshotParams = ScreenshotParams(quality = 1)
        }
    ).addAllureSupport().apply {
        testRunWatcherInterceptors.apply {
            add(object : TestRunWatcherInterceptor {
                override fun onTestFinished(testInfo: TestInfo, success: Boolean) {
                    viewHierarchyDumper.dumpAndApply("ViewHierarchy") { attachViewHierarchyToAllureReport() }
                }
            })
        }
    }
) {
...
}
```
If you don't need all of the interceptors that [**withAllureSupport**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/AllureSupportKaspressoBuilder.kt) and [**addAllureSupport**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/AllureSupportKaspressoBuilder.kt) functions provide you can just add all of the needed interceptors to your Kaspresso builder yourself. But please note that [**AllureMapperStepInterceptor.kt**](../allure-support/src/main/kotlin/com/kaspersky/components/alluresupport/interceptors/AllureMapperStepInterceptor.kt) is nescessary for Allure support work. For example, if you don't need videos to be recorded and view hierarchies be dumped after test failures, you can do something like:
```
class AllureSupportCustomizeTest : TestCase(
    kaspressoBuilder = Kaspresso.Builder.simple().apply {
        stepWatcherInterceptors.addAll(
            listOf(
                ScreenshotStepInterceptor(screenshots),
                AllureMapperStepInterceptor()
            )
        )
        testRunWatcherInterceptors.addAll(
            listOf(
                DumpLogcatTestInterceptor(logcatDumper),
                ScreenshotTestInterceptor(screenshots),
            )
        )
    }
) {
...
}
```
To watch, to launch and to experiment with all of this staff you can with special sample [**kaspresso-allure-support-sample**](../samples/kaspresso-allure-support-sample/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/kaspersky/kaspresso/alluresupport/sample).

## _Watch result_
So you added the list of needed Allure-supporting interceptors to your Kaspresso configuration and launched the test. After the test finishes there will be **sdcard/allure-results** dir created on the device with all the files processed to be included to Allure-report.

This dir should be moved from the device to the host machine which will do generate the report.

For example you can use **adb pull** command on your host for this. Let say you want to locate the data for the report at **/Users/username/Desktop**, so you call:
```
adb pull /sdcard/allure-results /Users/username/Desktop
```
If there are few devices connected to yout host you should specify the needed device id. To watch the list of connected devices you can call:
```
adb devices
```
The output will be something like:
```
List of devices attached
CLCDU18508004769	device
emulator-5554	device
```
Select the needed device and call:
```
adb -s emulator-5554 pull /sdcard/allure-results /Users/username/Desktop
```
And that's it, the **allure-results** dir with all the test resources is now at **/Users/username/Desktop**.

Now we want to generate and watch the report. The Allure server must be installed on our machine for this. To find out how to do it with all the details please follow the Allure docs at https://docs.qameta.io/allure/).

For example to install Allure server on MacOS we can use the following command:
```
brew install allure
```
Now we are ready to generate and watch the report, just call:
```
allure serve /Users/username/Desktop/allue-results
```
After this the Allure server will generate the html-page representing the report and put it to temp dir in your system. And you shall see the report opening in the new tab in your browser.

If you want to save the generated html-report to a specific dir for future use you can just call:
```
allure generate -o ~/kaspresso-allure-report /Users/username/Desktop/allure-results
```
And to watch it then in your browser you just call:
```
allure open ~/kaspresso-allure-report
```
After all of this actions you see something like:
