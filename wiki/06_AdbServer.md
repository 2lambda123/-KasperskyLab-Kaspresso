# Autotest AdbServer

## What is it?
As you remember from the [previous part devoted to Device interface](./05_Device.md) Device uses the following things under the hood:
1. Espresso
2. UI Automator
3. ADB

Yep, an attentive reader may notice that ADB is not enabled in Espresso tests! But Appium can. Thatâ€™s really bad news.
That's why we've written special Autotest AdbServer to compensate for the Espresso and UI Automator disadvantage. <br>
The main idea of the tool is so similar with the idea of Appium. We just have to build a simple client-server system 
where the client is a device running a test and the server is a desktop giving the command to execute tests on the device.
Also, we use a port forwarding to be able to organise a socket tunnel between a device and a desktop through any kind of connection (wi-fi, bluetooth, usb and etc.).

## Usage
The algorithm how to use Autotest AdbServer:
1. Run the Desktop part. <br>
In cmd, execute the following command: `java -jar <path-to-kaspresso>/artifacts/adbserver-desktop.jar`
2. Run the Device part. <br>
Build and start [adbserver-sample module](../adb-server/adbserver-sample). You will see the following screen:
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/rt/ia/zqrtiaglx5a1zc4ned-qykl0t_g.png" width="432" height="768"/>
For example, you can input `shell input text abc` in the EditText. As a result you will get `shell input text abcabc` 
in your EditText because ADB has executed the command and has added symbols `abc` into the focused EditText. <br>
You may notice that we use `AdbTerminal` in [adbserver-sample module](../adb-server/adbserver-sample) to execute ADB commands.

## Usage in Kaspresso
In Kaspresso, we wrap `AdbTerminal` into a special interface `AdbServer`.
**AdbServer** instance is available in `BaseTestContext` scope and `BaseTestCase` via `adbServer` property: <br>
```kotlin
@Test
fun test() =
    run {
        step("Open Simple Screen") {
            activityTestRule.launchActivity(null)
 ======>    adbServer.performShell("input text 1")   <======

            MainScreen {
                simpleButton {
                    isVisible()
                    click()
                }
            }
        }
        // ....
}
```
Please, don't forget to give a permission:
```gradle
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
``` 

## Options and Logging

### Desktop part
A developer can use several special flags when he starts `adbserver-desktop.jar`. <br>
For example, the possible command: `java -jar adbserver-desktop.jar -e emulator-5554,emulator-5556 -p 5041 -l VERBOSE`. <br>
Flags:
- `e`, `--emulators` - the list of emulators that can be captured by `adbserver-desktop.jar` (by default, `adbserver-desktop.jar` captures all available emulators)
- `p`, `--port` - the adb server port number (the default value is 5037)
- `l`, `--logs` - what type of logs show (the default value is INFO).

Let's consider available types of logs:
1. ERROR <br>
You will see only error messages. The example:
```
ERROR 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: Incorrect type of the message...
```
Please, have a look at the log format. You can observe the type of a message, date and time, the desktop executing the message and the emulator giving the task, and the message.

2. WARN <br>
You will see error and warning messages.

3. INFO <br>
The default value. Such type provides all base events. The example:
```
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:04.822  desktop=Desktop-25920    message: Desktop started with arguments: emulators=[], adbServerPort=null
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.859  desktop=Desktop-25920    message: New device has been found: emulator-5554. Initialize connection to the device...
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.892  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The connection establishment to device started
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: WatchdogThread is started from Desktop to Device
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: Desktop tries to connect to the Device.
 It may take time because the device can be not ready. Possible reason: a kaspresso test has not been started
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:20.185  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The attempt to connect to Device was success
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:47.810  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The received command to execute: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc)
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:49.115  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The executed command: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc). The result: CommandResult(status=SUCCESS, description=exitCode=0, message=, serviceInfo=The command was executed on desktop=Desktop-25920)
```
Also, the Desktop writes where the concrete command was executed (the information is available on the Desktop and on the Device). 
It could be very useful in debugging. Have a look at the field `serviceInfo` at the end:
```
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:49.115  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The executed command: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc). The result: CommandResult(status=SUCCESS, description=exitCode=0, message=, serviceInfo=The command was executed on desktop=Desktop-25920)
```

4. VERBOSE <br>
There are cases when a developer wants to debug Desktop part of Autotest AdbServer. That's why there is a special very detailed format - VERBOSE mode. <br>
Have a glance at logs reflecting similar events presented above (the initialising, the device connecting and the executing of one command):
```

```
Pay attention that a log row now contains two additional fields: `tag` and `method`. Both fields are autogenerated using `Throwable().stacktrace` method. 
Be aware of mentioned fact.

5. DEBUG <br>
It's a VERBOSE type but DEBUG can pack repeating pieces of logs. For example:
```

``` 

### Device part

In Kaspresso, the special interface `AdbServer` has a default implementation `AdbServerImpl`. This implementation set `WARN` log level for Autotest AdbServer.
So, you can observe such logs in any kaspresso test: <br>
```
2020-09-10 12:24:27.240 10349-10378/com.kaspersky.kaspressample I/KASPRESSO: ___________________________________________________________________________

```
Tag `KASPRESSO_ADBSERVER` describes logs from Autotest AdbServer with `WARN` log level. <br>
If you desire to debug the internals of Autotest AdbServer (the device part) then you can set `VERBOSE` log level:
```kotlin
class DeviceNetworkSampleTest : TestCase(
    kaspressoBuilder = Kaspresso.Builder.simple {
        libLogger = UiTestLoggerImpl(Kaspresso.DEFAULT_LIB_LOGGER_TAG)
        adbServer = AdbServerImpl(LogLevel.VERBOSE, libLogger)
    }
) {...}
```
The logs now:

```

## Development
All details about the Autotest AdbServer code are available in [adb-server module](../adb-server). <br>
If you want to build `adbserver-desktop.jar` then just execute `////`.
